My name is Mitch.

![Portrait](https://github.com/cakemountain/cakemountain.github.io/blob/main/static/portrait.png?raw=true =20x)

I'm a data engineer and software developer based out of Southeast Michigan. I love startups. I run, rock climb, and ride motorcycles. I have two cats and way too many plants.

_Kidding about the plants. I'm getting more._

The concept behind this blog is the title; it's the best and fastest learning process. As an engineer and Very Anxious Person I overanalyze. I've found my natural tendency is to spend hours or days agonizing over technical details that I end up disregarding in favor of alternatives learned from direct experience.

In reality, the best course of action is to narrow down options to a handful and try as many of them as possible, as effectively as possible, as quickly as possible. If you try something that doesn't yield the results you want, that's great! You've spent (read: _not_ wasted) all of a few minutes on it, and in return you've learned at least one lesson.

This blog will be a collection of writings on this theme and others with an occasional technical tutorial.

Until then,

Mitch
